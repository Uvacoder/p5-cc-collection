# Introduction to [p5js](https://p5js.org/) 
A growing collection of examples used to demonstrate basic concepts of creative coding on the modern web, focusing on algorithmic thinking, data manipulation and computer vision

## Installation & usage
- clone or download this repository
- download [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
- open sublime text, go to `tools/command palette`
- find `Package Control: Install Package`
- find `SublimeServer`, click to install
- restart Sublime Text
- open the downloaded repository *folder*, so you see all the files on the left bar
- under tools/sublime server, press `start sublime server`
- open a browser, and type in the address bar `localhost:8000` (8000 is the default port number)
- you can browse within the example code now
- if you edit your code, always save before checking it in the browser


## Folder Structure

### Basics
- introduction to the environment, mostly based on [this and corresponding](https://p5js.org/get-started/) tutorials

### Systems
- computational thinkig, working with algorithms and conditionals

### Data
- working with data: realtime, recorded (CSV), and API calls

### Computer Vision
- examples, using different js based vision frameworks 
- these are some modified versions of Kyle McDonald's [javascript-computervision collection](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/cv-examples)
- also, including handy machine learning code from [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/)

### Misc
- examples, related to different usage areas (deploying, platform specific stuff, etc)

### Libs
- Javascript libraries, dependencies of the examples we are working with
